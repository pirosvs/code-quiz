## Description
This project is an example of a dynamic quiz format, where the page continuously updates to show only the relevant information on the screen. The quiz itself displays knowledge of web APIs and dynamic Javascript, where innerHTML and template literals are used to render content on the page while removing previous content. Usage of web API methods in Javascript is preferred here over, for exmaple, writing directly in the HTML and hiding it in the CSS, as it makes the code appear neater and keeps the page from having to store content while it is not being displayed to the user. 
- code quiz to test fundamentals of javascript
- example test for future job assessments

- Skills used include basic HTML, CSS for the look of the page, JavaScript to create interactive elements. createElement in tandem with appendChild methods used to create an interactive application
- Use of string literal and innerHTML to disappear answered questions and appear new ones
